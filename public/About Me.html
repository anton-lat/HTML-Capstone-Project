    <h2>Hi! I'm Anton.</h2>
    <p>
         I'm 25 years old and still figuring life out, but I'm taking the steps to shape it toward something I can be proud of. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm currently working as a Marketing Officer for two companies, but I'm taking this web development class so I could hopefully work in a completely different field. I'm also taking a copywriting class and a separate creative writing one too (this one's just for me hehe). 
    </p>

    <p>
        For my hobbies, I like to read, play games, and watch stuff like movies/shows/anime. I'm trying to read more though, because I feel like it's better for my well-being. I'm currently reading <em>Katabasis</em> by R.F. Kuang. It's about two post-gradatuates who journey into hell on a quest to find the soul of their recently deceased advisor and bring him back. It's great! R.F. Kuang writes about life in academia with so much passion that it makes me want to go back to university haha.

        I also like to bake! I almost forgot to mention it because I haven't done it in so long, but I make really good cookies. One day, I wanna start my own little cookie business. It'll be called <em>Welsey's</em>, after my dog. I love him very much, and he's always by my side whenever I bake. Here's a picture of him:

    <p>I used to draw, but I haven't done so in a while. I'd really like to get back into it, but whenever I try I just end up scrolling for hours and hours until the day's gone. <a href="./Drawings.html">Here</a> are a few of my sketches I'm proud of, I mainly do portraits.</p>
