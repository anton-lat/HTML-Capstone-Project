    <h1>Drawings</h1>
<p>Not half bad I'd say. </p>

    <p>It doesn't look exactly like her in my opinion but I'm proud of my shading here, especially on her neck and the side of her face. I think this was my first time really blending with one of those paper pencil things and I think it looks great.</p>

    <h4><li>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</li></h4>

    <p>This was for a little Discord contest I joined and the theme was to draw a classical composer or painter. I think I chose Tchaikovsky because at the time I really enjoyed listening to <em>Valse Sentimentale, Op. 51, No.6</em> and <em>Swan Lake, Op. 20a: No. 1, Scène</em> on Spotify. I handed it in late so I didn't place or anything but I think it still turned out pretty good</p>

    <p>My friend and I had a bet to see who could draw her better. I think I had a hard time with her hair, and now that I look at it her jaw is definitely too large, but I'm pretty sure I still won. I like the shading I did on her bangs and the side of her face.</p>

    <br />
    <p>Anyway, that's all for now. If you took the time to read and look at my work, thank you! I appreciate it!</p>
